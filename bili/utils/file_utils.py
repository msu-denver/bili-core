Module: file_utils

This module provides utility functions for file processing and logging. It includes
functions to load JSON data, preprocess directories and files, and handle various file
types such as CSV, Excel, Word, JSON, HTML, Markdown, PDF, XML, and text files.

Functions:
    - load_from_json(file_path, parameter=None):
      Loads and parses JSON data from a file, optionally returning a specific parameter's
      value.
    - preprocess_directory(data_dir):
      Preprocesses the contents of a directory by applying a preprocessing function to
      each file.
    - preprocess_file(file_path):
      Preprocesses a file by determining its extension and delegating the processing to a
      specific function.
    - process_csv_data(file_path, _):
      Processes data from a CSV file using the `CSVLoader` utility.
    - process_excel_data(file_path, _):
      Processes data from an Excel file using the `UnstructuredExcelLoader`.
    - process_word_data(file_path, _):
      Processes data from a Word document using the `UnstructuredWordDocumentLoader`.
    - process_json_data(file_path, _):
      Processes JSON data from a file using the `JSONLoader`.
    - process_html_data(file_path, _):
      Processes HTML data from a file using the `BSHTMLLoader`.
    - process_markdown_data(file_path, _):
      Processes Markdown data from a file using the `UnstructuredMarkdownLoader`.
    - process_pdf_data(file_path, _):
      Processes PDF data from a file using the `PyPDFLoader`.
    - process_xml_data(file_path, _):
      Processes XML data from a file using the `UnstructuredXMLLoader`.
    - process_text_data(file_path, _):
      Processes text data from a file using the `TextLoader`.
    - process_unstructured_data(file_path, _):
      Processes unstructured data from a file using the `UnstructuredFileLoader`.

Dependencies:
    - json: Provides functions to parse JSON data.
    - os: Provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.
    - langchain_community.document_loaders: Imports various document loaders for different
      file types.
    - bili.utils.logging_utils: Imports `get_logger` for logging.

Usage:
    This module is intended to be used for file processing tasks within the application. It
    provides functions to load and preprocess various file types, making it easier to handle
    different data formats.

Example:
    from bili.utils.file_utils import load_from_json

    # Load JSON data from a file
    data = load_from_json("path/to/file.json")
