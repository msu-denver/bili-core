Module: pg_checkpointer

This module provides functions to manage PostgreSQL checkpointing for
conversation states within a Streamlit application. It includes functions to
initialize a PostgreSQL connection pool, close the pool, and create a PostgreSQL
checkpointer.

Functions:
    - get_pg_connection_pool():
      Initializes and returns a shared PostgreSQL connection pool if the
      `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable is set.
    - close_pg_connection_pool():
      Closes the shared PostgreSQL connection pool if it exists.
    - get_pg_checkpointer():
      Creates and returns a PostgreSQL checkpointer instance if a PostgreSQL
      connection pool can be successfully initialized.

Dependencies:
    - atexit: Provides functions to register cleanup functions at program exit.
    - os: Provides functions to interact with the operating system.
    - langgraph.checkpoint.postgres: Imports PostgresSaver for PostgreSQL-based
      checkpointing.
    - psycopg_pool: Provides ConnectionPool for managing PostgreSQL connections.
    - bili.streamlit.utils.streamlit_utils: Imports conditional_cache_resource
      for caching resources conditionally.
    - bili.utils.logging_utils: Imports get_logger for logging purposes.

Usage:
    This module is intended to be used within a Streamlit application to manage
    PostgreSQL checkpointing of conversation states. It provides functions to
    initialize a PostgreSQL connection pool, close the pool, and create a
    PostgreSQL checkpointer.

Example:
    from bili.streamlit.checkpointer.pg_checkpointer import \
        get_pg_connection_pool, get_pg_checkpointer

    # Get the PostgreSQL connection pool
    pg_connection_pool = get_pg_connection_pool()

    # Get the PostgreSQL checkpointer
    pg_checkpointer = get_pg_checkpointer()
