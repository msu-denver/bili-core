Module: app

This module serves as the main entry point for the Streamlit application. It
includes functions to configure the Streamlit environment, determine the
appropriate checkpointer, and execute the main application logic.

Functions:
    - main(): Sets up the main entry point for the Streamlit application,
              configures the Streamlit page layout, determines the appropriate
              checkpointer, and runs the main application page logic.
    - configure_streamlit(): Configures the Streamlit application for the Bili
                             Core Sandbox, setting the page configurations,
                             displaying the application logo, and providing
                             initial instructions for the user interface.

Dependencies:
    - os: Provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.
    - pathlib: Provides object-oriented filesystem paths.
    - streamlit: Streamlit library for building web applications.
    - PIL: Python Imaging Library for image processing.
    - bili.checkpointers.checkpointer_functions: Imports get_checkpointer
      function to determine the appropriate checkpointer (PostgresSaver or
      MemorySaver).
    - bili.streamlit.ui.auth_ui: Imports check_auth and initialize_auth_manager
      functions for authentication.
    - bili.streamlit.ui.chat_interface: Imports run_app_page function to run
      the main application logic.

Usage:
    This module is intended to be executed as a script to start the Streamlit
    application. It configures the Streamlit environment, determines the
    appropriate checkpointer, and runs the main application page logic.

Example:
    To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m bili.app
    ```

    This will start the Streamlit application with the configured settings and
    checkpointer.
