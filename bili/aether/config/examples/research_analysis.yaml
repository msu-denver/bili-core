# Research Analysis Workflow (Domain-Agnostic Example)
# =============================================================================
#
# This example demonstrates AETHER's domain-agnostic design by showing
# a research workflow that has nothing to do with content moderation.
#
# Pattern: researcher → fact_checker → analyst → synthesizer
#
# Use case: Analyze a research topic by gathering information, verifying
# facts, performing analysis, and synthesizing a final report.

description: >
  A four-stage research pipeline demonstrating AETHER's domain-agnostic
  design. Agents have custom roles like researcher, fact_checker, analyst,
  and synthesizer - not limited to content moderation roles.
version: "1.0.0"

workflow_type: sequential

agents:
  - agent_id: researcher
    role: researcher
    objective: >
      Search for and gather information on the given research topic.
      Compile relevant sources, data points, and findings for further
      analysis by downstream agents.
    temperature: 0.5
    capabilities:
      - web_search
      - document_analysis
      - source_gathering
    tools:
      - serp_api_tool
    output_format: json

  - agent_id: fact_checker
    role: fact_checker
    objective: >
      Verify the claims and data gathered by the researcher. Cross-reference
      sources, identify potential inaccuracies, and flag claims that need
      additional verification.
    temperature: 0.2
    capabilities:
      - source_verification
      - claim_analysis
      - web_search
    tools:
      - serp_api_tool
    output_format: json

  - agent_id: analyst
    role: analyst
    objective: >
      Analyze the verified research findings. Identify patterns, trends,
      and insights. Provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of the
      data gathered by previous agents.
    temperature: 0.3
    capabilities:
      - data_analysis
      - pattern_recognition
      - statistical_reasoning
    output_format: json

  - agent_id: synthesizer
    role: synthesizer
    objective: >
      Synthesize all research, fact-checking, and analysis into a coherent
      final report. Summarize key findings, highlight important insights,
      and provide recommendations based on the analysis.
    temperature: 0.4
