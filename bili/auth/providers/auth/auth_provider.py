Module: auth_provider

This module defines the `AuthProvider` class, which serves as a base class for
authentication providers. It includes methods for signing in, retrieving account
information, sending email verifications, sending password reset emails, creating
users, and deleting users. Each method raises a `NotImplementedError` and is
intended to be implemented by subclasses.

Classes:
    - AuthProvider: Base class for authentication providers.

Methods:
    - sign_in(email, password):
      Initiates a sign-in operation with the provided email and password.
    - get_account_info(uid):
      Retrieves account information for the provided uid.
    - send_email_verification(auth_details):
      Sends an email verification for a given user.
    - send_password_reset_email(email):
      Sends a password reset email to a user.
    - create_user(email, password):
      Creates a user with the specified email and password.
    - delete_user(uid):
      Deletes a user from the system.

Usage:
    This module is intended to be used as a base class for implementing
    authentication providers. Subclasses should implement the methods to
    provide the actual functionality.

Example:
    class MyAuthProvider(AuthProvider):
        def sign_in(self, email, password):
            # Implement sign-in logic here
            pass

        def get_account_info(self, uid):
            # Implement account info retrieval logic here
            pass

        def send_email_verification(self, auth_details):
            # Implement email verification logic here
            pass

        def send_password_reset_email(self, email):
            # Implement password reset email logic here
            pass

        def create_user(self, email, password):
            # Implement user creation logic here
            pass

        def delete_user(self, uid):
            # Implement user deletion logic here
            pass
