"""
Module: RoleProvider

This module defines the `RoleProvider` interface, which outlines the methods
required for managing user roles and checking user authorization based on
roles. Implementations of this interface should provide the actual
functionality for retrieving user roles and verifying authorization.

Classes:
    - RoleProvider: Interface for user role management and authorization.

Methods:
    - get_user_role(uid, token):
      Retrieves the role of a user based on the provided ID token.
    - is_authorized(uid, token, required_roles):
      Checks if a user is authorized based on their role.

Usage:
    This module is intended to be used as a base class for implementing user
    role management and authorization. Subclasses should implement the methods
    to provide the actual functionality.

Example:
    class MyRoleProvider(RoleProvider):
        def get_user_role(self, uid, token):
            # Implement role retrieval logic here
            pass

        def is_authorized(self, uid, token, required_roles):
            # Implement authorization logic here
            pass

    Interface for role-based access control.

    This class provides the structure and methods required to implement
    role-based access control in an application. It includes methods for
    retrieving a user's role and verifying if the user is authorized based
    on a set of required roles. Subclasses should implement the `get_user_role`
    method to define how roles are retrieved.

    Implementations of this class can be customized to integrate with
    various identity providers or role management systems.
