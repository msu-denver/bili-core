Module: ProfileProvider

This module defines the `ProfileProvider` interface, which outlines the
methods required for managing user profiles. Implementations of this
interface should provide the actual functionality for creating and
retrieving user profiles.

Classes:
    - ProfileProvider: Interface for user profile management.

Methods:
    - create_user_profile(id_token, user_id, first_name, last_name):
      Creates a user profile with the provided details.
    - get_user_profile(id_token):
      Retrieves user profile information based on the provided ID token.

Usage:
    This module is intended to be used as a base class for implementing
    user profile management. Subclasses should implement the methods to
    provide the actual functionality.

Example:
    class MyProfileProvider(ProfileProvider):
        def create_user_profile(self, id_token, user_id, first_name, last_name):
            # Implement profile creation logic here
            pass

        def get_user_profile(self, id_token):
            # Implement profile retrieval logic here
            pass
